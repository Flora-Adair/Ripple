                   Hey, I'm Flora ðŸ˜„ I created Ripple because I believe there is sometimes a disconnect between dorm parents, prefects, and boarding students. ðŸ’”
                   This is an app where you can log your mood anonymously, and dorm parents will be able to see the general vibe of their dorm every night, with analytics ðŸ“ˆ
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    If you are a dorm parent or prefect, please login to see the data of your dorm. If you are a student, please register your name and dorm. Thanks for participating!
